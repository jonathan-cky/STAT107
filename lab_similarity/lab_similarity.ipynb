    "### Puzzle 3.2: Your Lab Twin\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, chances are your twin isn't in your lab section. Because we conveniently have our row, `Similarity Score` applied to the **entire** set of responses to the survey, we can create smaller DataFrames to answer more questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find the person most similar to you in **your lab section**, otherwise known as your lab twin! We can create a new DataFrame to answer this question. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, some of your CAs and TAs, who are part of your lab section, are in more than one lab section! Those who have multiple sections have `Y##, Y##...` in their Sections column. How can we create a DataFrame that includes the CAs and TAs who are in more than one lab section? Python saves the day again.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The `contains` Function**\n",
    "In Python, the `contains` function can be used to check if a specific **substring** is present in a **string**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will come in handy for us, because we can see if `Y##` is in the **names** of any rows in our DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `contains` function, create a **new DataFrame** with everyone in your lab section: `df_section`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the statement has been completed for you to show you how to use `contains`. Complete it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that we have to cast our `Name` column of `df` to a **string** by using `.str`.\n",
